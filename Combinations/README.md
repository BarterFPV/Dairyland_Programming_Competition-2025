You and your math professor get into an argument. During class, you mention how interesting it is that you can create any number using combinations of the numbers 1, 2, and 3. Your professor disagrees, insisting you're incorrect. After some back-and-forth discussion, you decide to prove your point by demonstrating all possible combinations for each number provided by your professor.

To do this, you need to write a program that takes a specific number as input and displays all possible ways to sum up to that number using only the numbers 1, 2, and 3.

Example 

input
5

output
1+1+1+1+1
1+1+1+2
1+1+2+1
1+1+3
1+2+1+1
1+2+2
1+3+1
2+1+1+1
2+1+2
2+2+1
2+3
3+1+1
3+2
